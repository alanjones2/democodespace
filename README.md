# Streamlit app template
Use this as the basis of a Streamlit app that can be used in Codespaces 
and deployed to the Streamlit Community Cloud

The default app name is _app.py_ if you wish to change it don't forget to 
change the file names in _devcontainer.json_ in the _devcontainer_ folder.

Also, you will need to add any libraries that you use to the _requirements.txt_ file
